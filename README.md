This Solidity smart contract named "MyToken" defines a custom token on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows the creation, tracking, and destruction of tokens.

#Public variables:
tokenName - a string that represents the name of the token
tokenAbbrv - a string that represents the abbreviation of the token
totalSupply - an unsigned integer that represents the total supply of the token

#Mapping variable:
balances - a mapping that associates an address with its token balance

#Functions:
mint - a function that mints new tokens and assigns them to an address. It takes two arguments, an address _address and an unsigned integer _value. It increases the total supply of the token and updates the balance of the _address by adding _value.
burn - a function that destroys existing tokens from an address. It takes two arguments, an address _address and an unsigned integer _value. It checks if the _address has enough tokens to burn and if so, it decreases the total supply of the token and updates the balance of the _address by subtracting _value.
